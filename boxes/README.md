3D Printable Mounts and Boxes
=========================

Here are some boxes and holders for Espruino that you can print.

They are in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) format which means that they can be easily tweaked to different sizes.

**BEWARE:** These have been designed on a 3D printer that is not totally calibrated, and as such could do with some adjustment before printing. Please feel free to contribute back your changes and designs.
